# Linear-Regression
Simple Linear Regression code made from scratch in python 3.0, showing the canonical and gradient descent versions and their respective versions with and without regularization.
The code will show, in each of the versions, the behaviour if the cost function and the approximation line obtained from the model at the end of the training.
You can use a sintetic dataset inside the code or an external dataset (e.g. "blood_pressure.txt"). In this case, two-dimensional datasets were used.
